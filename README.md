# Dissertation_Data-Visualization

Welcome to the repository containing scripts utilized for the analysis of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in my dissertation. Please note that the raw data is excluded due to confidentiality concerns. However, I plan to incorporate mock input files in the future, allowing users to follow the data cleaning and wrangling processes seamlessly. The final plots and tables are included as .png or .xlsx files.
